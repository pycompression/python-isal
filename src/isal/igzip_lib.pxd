    #/**
    #  * @brief Fast data (deflate) compression for storage applications.
    #  *
    #  * The call to isal_deflate() will take data from the input buffer (updating
    #  * next_in, avail_in and write a compressed stream to the output buffer
    #  * (updating next_out and avail_out). The function returns when either the input
    #  * buffer is empty or the output buffer is full.
    #  *
    #  * On entry to isal_deflate(), next_in points to an input buffer and avail_in
    #  * indicates the length of that buffer. Similarly next_out points to an empty
    #  * output buffer and avail_out indicates the size of that buffer.
    #  *
    #  * The fields total_in and total_out start at 0 and are updated by
    #  * isal_deflate(). These reflect the total number of bytes read or written so far.
    #  *
    #  * When the last input buffer is passed in, signaled by setting the
    #  * end_of_stream, the routine will complete compression at the end of the input
    #  * buffer, as long as the output buffer is big enough.
    #  *
    #  * The compression level can be set by setting level to any value between
    #  * ISAL_DEF_MIN_LEVEL and ISAL_DEF_MAX_LEVEL. When the compression level is
    #  * ISAL_DEF_MIN_LEVEL, hufftables can be set to a table trained for the the
    #  * specific data type being compressed to achieve better compression. When a
    #  * higher compression level is desired, a larger generic memory buffer needs to
    #  * be supplied by setting level_buf and level_buf_size to represent the chunk of
    #  * memory. For level x, the suggest size for this buffer this buffer is
    #  * ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_DEFAULT. The defines ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_MIN, ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_SMALL,
    #  * ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_MEDIUM, ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_LARGE, and ISAL_DEFL_LVLx_EXTRA_LARGE
    #  * are also provided as other suggested sizes.
    #  *
    #  * The equivalent of the zlib FLUSH_SYNC operation is currently supported.
    #  * Flush types can be NO_FLUSH, SYNC_FLUSH or FULL_FLUSH. Default flush type is
    #  * NO_FLUSH. A SYNC_ OR FULL_ flush will byte align the deflate block by
    #  * appending an empty stored block once all input has been compressed, including
    #  * the buffered input. Checking that the out_buffer is not empty or that
    #  * internal_state.state = ZSTATE_NEW_HDR is sufficient to guarantee all input
    #  * has been flushed. Additionally FULL_FLUSH will ensure look back history does
    #  * not include previous blocks so new blocks are fully independent. Switching
    #  * between flush types is supported.
    #  *
    #  * If a compression dictionary is required, the dictionary can be set calling
    #  * isal_deflate_set_dictionary before calling isal_deflate.
    #  *
    #  * If the gzip_flag is set to IGZIP_GZIP, a generic gzip header and the gzip
    #  * trailer are written around the deflate compressed data. If gzip_flag is set
    #  * to IGZIP_GZIP_NO_HDR, then only the gzip trailer is written. A full-featured
    #  * header is supported by the isal_write_{gzip,zlib}_header() functions.
    #  *
    #  * @param  stream Structure holding state information on the compression streams.
    #  * @return COMP_OK (if everything is ok),
    #  *         INVALID_FLUSH (if an invalid FLUSH is selected),
    #  *         ISAL_INVALID_LEVEL (if an invalid compression level is selected),
